There is easy touring to the North Norfolk Coast, with Holt and Burnham Market (known as the Hamptons of Norfolk) just 12 miles, with delicatessen and excellent shopping, first class pubs and restaurants. Cromer (possibly most famous for its crabs), Sheringham and Caister all offering sandy beaches.

Design and implement a website using Python Flask framework

Core features:
--------------
- each page must be rendered as a template in Flask (done!)
- comments functionality must be done on server-side (saved as lists; use CSV format I guess) - done, independent testing required
- booking facility for property (saved as lists; use CSV format I guess)

Advanced features (but it would be nice to implement them):
--------------
- HTTPS with proper certificate (use Let's Encrypt)
- limiting amount of comments per page
- modifying comments (use Ajax)
- deleting comments (use Ajax)
- detecting duplicate bookings
- user authentication
- password protection (hashing with salt)
- admin level authentication and admin panel
- modifying bookings (use Ajax)
- deleting bookings (use Ajax)
- different costs of bookings depending on variables
- possibly more
